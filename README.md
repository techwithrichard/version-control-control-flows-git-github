# Control Flow in R

This repository demonstrates control flow concepts in R, divided into three main categories:

## 1. Sequential
- Code executes line by line, in order.

## 2. Selection
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`) to make decisions.

## 3. Iteration
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `repeat`) to repeat actions.

Each section contains R code examples to illustrate these concepts.  
Use these examples to understand and practice control flow in R programming.
